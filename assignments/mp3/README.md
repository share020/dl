# HW3: Train a deep convolution network on a GPU with PyTorch for the CIFAR10 dataset.

> The convolution network should use (A) dropout, (B) trained with RMSprop or ADAM, and (C) data augmentation.
> 
> For 10% extra credit, compare dropout test accuracy (i) using the heuristic prediction rule and (ii) Monte Carlo simulation.
> 
> For full credit, the model should achieve 80-90% Test Accuracy. Submit via Compass (1) the code and (2) a paragraph (in a PDF document) which reports the results and briefly describes the model architecture.
>
> Due September 28 at 5:00 PM.
